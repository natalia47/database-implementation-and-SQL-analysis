I've always been intrigued by zodiac signs. As an Aries myself, I've often heard that we're natural-born leaders. But does this trait hold true for all Aries? If so, we might expect to find a significant number of Aries at the helm of Fortune 500 companies.

This curiosity led me to embark on a project initially focused on exploring the zodiac signs of CEOs, which later evolved into a broader investigation into potential patterns in CEO education, origin, and career trajectory. Can data shed light on whether CEOs are innately destined to lead, or are there other influential factors at play? How do they ascend to the top spot, and what factors contribute to their success? Moreover, are there any insights from their experiences that we can apply to our own career paths?

To address these questions, I delved into several inquiries:

Does a CEO's zodiac sign correlate with their leadership abilities?
Do factors such as education or geographical location provide an advantage?
Is there a relationship between age, gender, and CEO status?
What pathways do Fortune 500 CEOs typically follow to reach their positions?

For my analysis, I utilized the following data sources:

The 2022 Fortune 1000 Dataset obtained from Kaggle, specifically the subset pertaining to Fortune 500 CEOs (labeled as f500_ceo).
Supplementary data collected to enhance the Fortune 500 subset (labeled as f500_ceo_add).

I conducted my work using the following Oracle products:

Oracle Free Tier Cloud ATP Database, 
Oracle SQL Developer

Feel free to explore my findings and join the discussion on the age-old question: are leaders born or made?
